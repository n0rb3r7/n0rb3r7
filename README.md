# Willkommen!
Hallo! :wave: I'm Norbert and I'm a **web developer** and also **designer**. I used to be a **peasant** in my childhood, living in the nature with cows, chickens, goats, geese and an old 486 PC. Since then I've created stuff in wood, paper, soil and lately with code. 
After years of changes, in 2017 I started with my own business to provide my services which can be reached here [Stange Studio](https://stangestudio.com/).
> I suck at updating my social networks, that's why I love my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/es/user/N0rb3r7/) (it does it all).

I`m currently learning Hugo + Forestry + Netlify. 
I can drink a beer and have a convo speaking in **Spanish**, **English** and **German**, for now...
