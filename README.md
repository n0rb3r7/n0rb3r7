### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome!

Hallo! :wave: I'm Norbert and I work as **web developer** and as a **designer**. I used to be a **peasant** in my childhood, living in the nature with cows, chickens, goats, geese and an old 486 PC. Since then I've created stuff in wood, paper, soil and through bits. 
After years of changes in 2017 I started with my own business to provide my services wich can be reach here [Stange Studio](https://stangestudio.com/).
> I suck at updating my social networks, that's why I love my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/es/user/N0rb3r7/) (it does it all).

#### Currently working on

* LearnPress implementation for a local entrepreneurship.
* Something more :thinking: 
* Updating all my media
